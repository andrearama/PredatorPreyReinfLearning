# PredatorPreyReinfLearning
Reinforcement Learning in a Predator Prey model.
Basically an implementation with some modification of the paper “An Agent-Based Predator-Prey Model with Reinforcement Learning” by  M. Olsen and R. Fraczkowski.

## Prerequisites
- Python 2 or 3

## Getting Started
### Installation
- The requred libraries are matplotlib, numpy and pandas (any recent version would be fine).
You can install all the dependencies by:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrearama/PredatorPreyReinfLearning
cd PredatorPreyReinfLearning
```

### Run the Simulation
Just start the simulation by launching the main program. It is possible to change the default standards (look at the main file for more information)
```bash
python Main.py --gridDim 70 --nGrass 1400
```
